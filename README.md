# SNAZE - A snake Trapped in a Maze
## Linguagem de Programação 1 - DIM0120 - 2020.6

This project aims to build a simulation of Snake Arcade, executed in text mode via terminal.

In the development of this project was used architecture Game Loop and Backtracking.

**Game Loop** is the overall flow control for the entire game program, is broken up into three distinct phases: processing inputs, updating the game world, and generating outputs. _To more info about Game Loop_ [Click Here.](http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/game-loop.html).

**Backtracking** is a algorthm used to find all candidates to solutions to some computational problems, each candidates to the solution is tested and abandons if that candidate that cannot be a solution. _To more info about Backtracking_ [Click Here.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backtracking)

### Compilation
To compile the program use [Makefile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makefile).
| Command | Desciption |
| ------- | ------- |
| `make all` | Compile All Project. |
| `make run` | Run the Program. |
| `make clear` | Remove files of compilation. |
